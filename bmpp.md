## Demo

Check the quick presentation about autogenerating code from a BMPP definition to performant code in the [Vibelang demo page](/vibelang-rs).

## Implementation

[**Explore BMPP Agents for scalable, distributed computation in Rust.**](https://github.com/Mec-iS/bmpp-agents-rs)
Unlock robust protocol logic, interoperability, and formal safety for multi-agent systemsâ€”directly from a cutting-edge Rust implementation.

Key features:
- generate your agents from formally verified distributed computing processes
- fast and security tested Rust implementation
- designed for research and deployment use
